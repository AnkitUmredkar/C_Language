
# What is  Asynchronous Programming?

Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows tasks or operations to run independently and concurrently, without waiting for each other to complete before moving on to the next task. 

# What is Future Class ?

In Dart, a Future represents a value that may not be available yet. It encapsulates an asynchronous operation and provides a way to handle the result or error when it becomes available.  

# What is Duration class & Future.delayed() constructor with Example ?

## Duration Calss
The Duration class represents a span of time. It allows you to specify time durations in terms of hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.    

## Example
```javascript
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:io';

void main(){
  Timer(
    Duration(seconds: 3),
    (){
      print("Hello Dart");
    }
  );
}
```

## Future.delayed()
Future.delayed() is a method in Dart that creates a future representing a delayed computation. It allows you to schedule a task to be executed after a specified duration of time has passed.  

## Example
```javascript
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:io';

void main(){
  Future.delayed(
    Duration(seconds: 3),
    (){
      print("Hello Dart");
    }
  );
}
```

# What is the Use of the async & await keyword?

In Flutter, async and await are used to perform asynchronous operations in a more readable and structured manner. They are part of the Dart language, on which Flutter is built.

## async keyword

The async keyword is used to mark a function as asynchronous.

## async keyword

The await keyword is used to pause the execution of an asynchronous function until a particular asynchronous operation is completed.

# What is Recursion ? With Example.

When function call itself it's called recursion

## Example
```javascript
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:io';

void main(){
  Timer.periodic(Duration(seconds: 3), (timer) {
    print("Hello Dart");
   });
}
```

# What is Timer class with example ?

When function call itself it's called recursion

## Example
```javascript
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:io';

void main(){
  Timer.periodic(Duration(seconds: 3), (timer) {
    print("Hello Dart");
   });
}
```
